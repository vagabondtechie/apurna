# apurna

**apurna** is a Java library for computing skyline objects in incomplete datasets. It is meant to be just included as a jar and use with just 3-4 lines of code. Of course, configurability and extensibility has also been kept in mind while designing the library.

Some noteworthy features of the library are:
* Computation of skyline set objects as well as skyline points
* Utilities to generate synthetic data
* Abstraction of most of the entities of DB related concepts i.e Database, Tuples etc
* Implementation of factory design pattern to have more control of algorithm object creation and seperation of interface from implementation

apurna is work in progress. We would like collaborators to make it better and suitable for general usage.
